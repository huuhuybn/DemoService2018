# Summary

Folding utility knife.  Liner locking design.  Takes standard utility knife/razor blades.  When you blade goes dull, don't sharpen it, exchange it!  Requires one M3 x 10mm screw.  Prints as one assembly with built-in supports.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: MendelMax
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
Resolution: Optimized for 0.6mm extrusion width with Slic3r 1.2.9
Infill: 50% or more

Notes: 
Raft highly recommended due to some small/narrow features that may lift from the print surface otherwise.  DO NOT generate support material.  All necessary supports are included already.

# Post-Printing

After printing, remove support material carefully with a knife and small pliers.  Depending on printer, the blade holder may be slightly stuck to the body.  It is easiest to carefully force the knife open slightly further than full open, which should break free the blade holder from the liner lock feature and the pivot pin.

Insert a standard utility knife blade into the blade holder and secure by threading an M3 x 10mm screw into the plastic.

To close the knife, push the liner lock out of the way and fold.

# How I Designed This

Designed in SolidWorks.  Inspired by the Gerber EAB knife.
